# Calculator-GUI-with-Python

__Project : Calculator GUI with Python__

In this Project, I will take you through how to create a Calculator GUI with Python programming language.
Here I will use the Kivy package in Python to build a Calculator GUI.

Kivy is a free, Open Source Python library that enables the rapid and easy development of highly interactive cross-platform applications.
Kivyâ€™s execution speed is the same as compared to the other mobile development alternatives like Java for Android and Objective C for iOS.
